# What is Data Warehousing(DWH)? 

- to understand DWH lets consider there is a bank with multiple branches across different locations
- customers are coming and interacting to bank's branches on daily basis and doing transactions with bank
- Now at some point - lets say every quarter, bank would need to consolidate all data at one place to understand how it is performing on overall basis and to formulate strategies for bank in the future.
- To do this it will transfer all data from different branches to one place where from it can access and do various kind of analysis
- This is called DWH where data from diff locations are stored at first place. This data is called Transactional data.
- Updating data to DWH usually happens on Day 2 day basis
- We can then use this data for analysis or reporting purpose.


**Definition**:

- **Data Warehousing combines data from multiple sources into one database which can be used for analysis or reporting purpose**.

### Features of DWH:

- Data collected is **subject oriented** or specific kind of data.
- Also, this is **integrated data** as this is collected from multiple sources
- Also, this data is **time variant** as this is historical data but not live data.
- This is **non-volatile** data so it won't change for certain period of time. No DML operation should be done on this data.
